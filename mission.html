			The <b><i>Save Your Seeds</i></b> campaign has one simple purpose, to expose the absurdity of the United States government's eradication program of hemp and marijuana. We feel it is ridiculous to try to kill off a plant that occurs naturally and is actually good for our environment. Each year our government wastes millions of our tax dollars on the extermination of hemp, also called cannabis ruderalis, which will not get users high like the two other species of cannabis, sativa and indica. So our mission with this campaign, besides exposing the program, is to encourage people to save their marijuana seeds and disperse them everywhere. We do not advocate for cultivation, as cultivation of cannabis is illegal. Rather, we advocate for disposal in areas that allow for natural growth. Plants are naturally proliferated through a variety of methods. Seeds ride the wind, stick to animal fur, or are spread through scat. Our goal is simply to be one more of those natural methods.</br>
			</br>
			We believe this project is important because we are spreading the idea that our government's war on drugs is so ignorant and mismanaged, that they are wasting millions of dollars each year to, in essence, kill plants used to make rope and textiles simply because they look like marijuana plants. We also feel that the effort to kill wild cannabis plants does absolutely nothing to reduce marijuana use in this country; it is a failed policy. By simply eliminating this eradication program, we could channel this money somewhere else and pay for other programs that actually make a difference and help society.
